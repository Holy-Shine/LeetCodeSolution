# 16. 3Sum Closest
Given an array *S* of *n* integers, find three integers in *S* such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

		For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
        
        The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

## My thought 
Just do like NO.15.What is different is that we dont need to find a triplet.  
First sort the array.Then use three pointer go through the array.Time cost is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

	class Solution {
	public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int len = nums.size();
        int crt,front,back,sum;
        int close = 0x7fffffff;
        int ret;
        for(int crt=0;crt<len-2;++crt){
            front = crt+1;
            back = len-1;
            while(front<back){
                sum = nums[crt]+nums[front]+nums[back];
                if(sum>target){
                    if(sum-target<close){
                        ret = sum;
                        close = sum-target;
                    }
                    back--;
                }
                else if(sum<target){
                    if(target-sum<close){
                        ret = sum;
                        close = target-sum;
                    }
                    front++;
                }
                else
                    return target;
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
	};
