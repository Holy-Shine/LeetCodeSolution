# 11.Container With Most Water
Given *n* non-negative integers *a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>*,where each represents a point at coordinate (*i，a<sub>i</sub>* ). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i*  is at (*i，a<sub>i</sub>* ) and (*i，0 *).Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
Note: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.  
# My Thought 
Greedy algorithm.  
As given n lines with different length and X(gap 1),we are required to find a biggest container,we could utilize two pointers point begin and end respectively. Than move them following this rule: if the line that pointer point has the lower height,move its point.Everytime we calculate the container size.
