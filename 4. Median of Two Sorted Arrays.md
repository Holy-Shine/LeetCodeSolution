# 4.Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.  
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).  
**Example 1:**

	nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]
    
    The median is 2.0
**Example 2:**

	nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]
    
    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
## My Thought
As both two arrays are sorted, we could use two **pointer** go through them.   
We set a new vector,at the same time,we compare each number one by one,put the  bigger one into **vector** and move its pointer to next number...  
If one **pointed** reach its end, we stop loop.Than we have remaining numbers putted into **vector**.  
Finally we get the median like this:  
$$\bf median = \frac{vec[(vec.size()-1)/2]+vec[(vec.size())/2]}{2}$$  
## Code(C++ 66ms)
	class Solution {
	public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        vector<int>::iterator p1 = nums1.begin();
        vector<int>::iterator p2 = nums2.begin();
        vector<int> vec;
        while(p1!=nums1.end()&&p2!=nums2.end()){
            if(*p1>*p2){
                vec.push_back(*p2);
                p2++;
            }
            else if(*p1<*p2){
                vec.push_back(*p1);
                p1++;
            }
            else{
                vec.push_back(*p1);
                vec.push_back(*p2);
                p1++;
                p2++;
            }
        }
        while(p1!=nums1.end()){
            vec.push_back(*p1);
            p1++;
        }
        while(p2!=nums2.end()){
            vec.push_back(*p2);
            p2++;
        }
         return ((double)(vec[(vec.size()-1)/2]+vec[(vec.size())/2]))/2;
    }
	};
  ## Another Idea 
  As given two arrays are fixed-length, we could pre-count its median index(odd:len/2...). So we can record the pointer's moving step.When it reach median index,we get the answer.
